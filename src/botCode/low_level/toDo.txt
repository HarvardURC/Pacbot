1. Copy-paste advance but change to use IMU heading ---> done
    still terminate when encoders traverse necessary distance --> done
2. Write function in motors.py to get heading call it getHeading()
    - create sensors object with separate thread to read from Serial
3. Write function that turns to heading and implement in a turnRight and a turnLeft
4. Initialize IMU direction with East being 0 - Tom
5. Write a turn to heading function 
    - terminate when within certain tolerance of desired heading
6. Add global variable that tracks current direction {N, S, E, W}
7. Update current direction in turnRight, turnLeft
8. call turntoheading and pass in heading
